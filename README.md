## NotesApp

This application is based on the note-wrangler application created by [Code School](https://www.codeschool.com/). Adding new implementations and custom sections.


## Getting Started

To get you started you can simply clone the notesApp repo and install the dependencies:

### Install Dependencies

You will need node.js installed to run this sample app, I recommend [Node Version Manager][nvm]. 
Check out the repo for installation directions: [nvm github][nvm]

* Install the server side node libraries we depend upon via `npm`, the [node package manager][npm].

We have preconfigured the app using `npm` to automatically run `bower` so we can simply do:

```
npm install
```
This creates a `node_modules` folder which contains the npm packages installed in the previous step

### Run the Application

We have preconfigured the project with a simple development web server.  The simplest way to start
this server is:

```
npm start
```

Now pull up your application at `http://localhost:8000/`. The default user is `demo` with a password of `secret`
